### My Character

No one can deny that everyone has advantages and disadvantages.Of course I has,too.

I am not a outgoing boy.Rather than say so, it's better to say that I can't express my points fluently which excludes the science such as cs(computer science),math and so on.

I am a boy of vanity.I am a tsundere boy.I don't want to be a boy that couldn't approach anyone's greatness,so I study hard to be stronger.
